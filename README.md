# IoT Hands on practice

## Background

These files was made for the practical part of an IoT Education given in
Sweden. The course is a mostly theoretical course and this material was only
for the practical part of the course.

The files here are mostly of interest to the students on the course but others
might fins something interesting as well.

## The exercises

In the exercises we will step by step build an IoT application including
hardware, software and using the platform IoT Open to connect it all together.

### 1st exercise

In this exercise we will control a LED on our breadboard using commands from an
application connected to IoT Open. This is exactly how a switch or any on/off
actuator works.

#### Material

- Raspberry Pi with 64bit operating system
- Breadboard and some connection cables
- A LED
- A 330 Ohm Resistor

#### Preparations

- Install Raspberry Pi OS 64bit on your Raspberry (if you haven't already). Make
  sure you can log in to it from your laptop.
- You should have an account on IoT Open

#### Learning goals

- Actuators (Control real things via IoT)
- Communication via MQTT
- Edge Clients
- How topic\_write works
- Starting point for following exercises
