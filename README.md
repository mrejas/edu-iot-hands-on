# IoT Hands on practice

## Background

These files was made for the practical part of an IoT Education given in Sweden for [TUC Sweden](https://www.tucsweden.se/). The course is a mostly theoretical course and this material is only for the practical part of the course.

The files here are mostly of interest to the students on the course but others might fins something interesting as well.

## The exercises

In the exercises we will step by step build an IoT application including hardware, software and using the platform IoT Open to connect it all together.

### First exercise (orientation and getting started)

In this exercise we will control a LED on our breadboard using commands from an application connected to IoT Open. This is exactly how a switch or any on/off actuator works.

### Second exercise (locally vs cloud)

This is a continuation of the first exercise. In this exercise we will add two buttons to the breadboard and use them to send a signal to the IoT Platform. The signal will then be used to control the LED from the first exercise. We will control the LED both Locally and via the IoT Open platform. This exercise also emphases the pros and cons with central and edge processing.

### Third exercise (expand the boundaries)

So far we have been working one by one. Now let's form pairs and make one button on a board control the LED on another board. Now we will be in the same room, but it works across the globe as well.
