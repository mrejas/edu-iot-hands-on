# IoT Exercise 1

In this exercise we will control a LED on our breadboard using commands from an
application connected to IoT Open. This is exactly how a switch or any on/off
actuator works.

## Material

- Raspberry Pi with 64bit operating system
- Breadboard and some connection cables
- A LED
- A 330 Ohm Resistor
- Some connection wires

## Preparations

- Install Raspberry Pi OS 64bit on your Raspberry (if you haven't already). Make
  sure you can log in to it from your laptop.
- You should have an account on IoT Open

## Learning goals

- Actuators (Control real things via IoT, unlike sensors that just collects data)
- Communication via MQTT
- Edge Clients
- How topic\_write works in IoT Open
- Starting point for following exercises
