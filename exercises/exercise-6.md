# IoT Exercise 6

This is a special last exercise. We did this in a conference room in Helsingborg sweden in June 2024. It probably want mean much to anyone else, but is kept here as reference.

## Material

- Everything we have used so far and more stuff if you want.

## Preparations

- Make sure that you have done the other exercises.

### Background and what we will do

In this exercise we will work together as one team. The goal is to turn the room we are in to smart building or even a smart city. We will use all the hardware we have and work together in one installation in IoT Open. We can split the logic over all our Node-RED and we can make a Grafana Dashboard.

## Learning goals

- Working together as one team. This is how reality often is.
- Make sure every participant gets some task and organize so it all works together.

## Steps to make this happen

### Milestone I (Planning)

The first task targets on defining the assignment and what should be done. First make a rough plan on what to include. In a real project this is most likely (but not always) defined before the project starts. Thing to include might be;

- Smart lighting (e.g. light controlled by presence)
- Burglar alarm
- Smart parking (e.g. get information about occupancy)
- Control heating or ventilation by presence
- Measure traffic?
- Temperature in the nearby lake?
- Imagination is the limit

Ok, now you might wander how this can be done. We are of course building a model of it all even though some things might be real. Make a plan together. A car might be a piece of paper, a parking space can be a chair and so on. A LED on a board might be the light in a whole street or building. A button on a board kan represent a car passing or a switch on the wall. Let the imagination go crazy!

We will use a board to do the planning.

Also try to be realistic. We will have one day to implement this. We might need to prioritize a little bit to have time to finish.

### Milestone II (Implementing)

Here teamwork is the key! Some of you might know more than your teammates. One of your most important tasks is to make sure every one is involved. All Raspberry Pi's must be included in the final solution. In a real life scenario it is not possible to do this alone.

The instructor will have the role as an advisor in the project and will help and answer questions. But the project is all yours!

### Milestone III (Testing)

Test some different scenarios. E.g. the family opens the front door and the light in the entrance turns on. Show all the 

### Reflection

This is actually a realistic example. In a real life scenario the persons involved will have different roles. In our exercise everyone is everything, but except for that it is actually kind of realistic.
